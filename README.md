# Hunger-Games-Simulator ‚öîÔ∏èüå≤
This is a simple game built with pygame that takes in names, or 'tributes', and simulates events that happen each day. A random number of tributes are selected to die each day and each tribute is randomly paired with an event. The types of events available for selection change depending on the day. The simulation continues until there is only one tribute left. May the odds be ever in your favor üå≤

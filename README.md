# Hunger-Games-Simulator
This is a simple game built with pygame that takes in names, or 'tributes', and simulates events that happen each day. A random number of tributes are selected to die each day and each tribute is randomly paired with an event. The events for each day are displayed on the screen, and the days continue until there is only one tribute left.
